# 💰 Tip Calculator

A web application built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS** that allows users to calculate tips quickly and easily. This project was a great opportunity to deepen my understanding of component management, custom hooks, and utility-first styling.

## ✨ Features

- 📋 **Interactive Menu**: Easily add or remove items from your order.
- 💰 **Tip Calculation**: Choose from predefined percentages (10%, 20%, 50%) to calculate the tip.
- 🧮 **Order Summary**: View the subtotal, tip, and total amount to pay.
- ♻️ **Reset Order**: Option to clear the order and tip selection.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- 🧑‍💻 [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
- ⚡ [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): Fast build tool for React and TypeScript projects.
- 🎨 [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
